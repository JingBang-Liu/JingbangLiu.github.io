<ul class="blurb">
    As an undergraduate, I studied Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at Shandong University, China and BSc 
    Mathematics at the University of Manchester. I graduated from both Universities in July 2018, with a 1st 
    class honours from Manchester. My final year project supervisor was <a href="https://personalpages.manch
    ester.ac.uk/staff/gareth.jones-10/">Dr Gareth Wyn Jones</a>. We studied the 
    thermoelastic properties of fibre reinforced composites and solved the problem analytically under simple 
    geometry. I then continued my study at the University of Oxford on MSc in Mathematical Modelling and 
    Scientific Computing and graduated with a merit. My dissertation supervisors are Prof. Irene Moroz and Dr 
    Hannah Christensen. We studied the dynamical properties of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) using the 
    Vallis 1986 model and explored the possible impacts of Greenhouse Warming on ENSO.

    I am now a new PhD student within the HetSys programme, under supervision of Dr James Sprittles and Prof 
    Duncan Lockerby.
