<p>As an undergraduate, I studied Mathematics and Applied Mathematics at Shandong University, China and BSc 
Mathematics at the University of Manchester. I graduated from both Universities in July 2018, with a 1st 
class honours from Manchester. My final year project supervisor was <a href="https://personalpages.manchester.ac.uk/staff/gareth.jones-10/">Dr Gareth Wyn Jones</a>.
We studied the thermoelastic properties of fibre reinforced composites and solved the problem analytically under simple 
geometry. I then continued my study at the University of Oxford on MSc in Mathematical Modelling and 
Scientific Computing and graduated with a merit. My dissertation supervisors are <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/irene.moroz">Prof. Irene Moroz</a> 
and <a href="http://hannahchristensen.co.uk/">Dr. Hannah Christensen</a>.
We studied the dynamical properties of El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) using the 
Vallis 1986 model and explored the possible impacts of Greenhouse Warming on ENSO.</p>


<p>I am now a new PhD student within the HetSys programme, under supervision of <a href="https://jamessprittles.com/">Dr. James Sprittles</a> 
and <a href="https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/eng/staff/dal/">Prof. Duncan Lockerby</a>.</p>
