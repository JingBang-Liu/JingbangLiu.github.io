*A series of study notes reading Fluid Mechanics by L.D. Landau and E.M. Lifshitz. The two giants in the world of physics.*

In the last note we presented the conservation of mass, equilibration of forces for ideal fluid, i.e. fluid without energy dissipation occurring during the motion of the fluid. However, in real life like water and honey, fluids are viscous and thermal conduction occurs all the time. In order to obtain the equations describing the motion of a viscous fluid, we need additional terms. Conservation of mass always hold no matter what. Equilibration of forces on the other hand, requires modification.
